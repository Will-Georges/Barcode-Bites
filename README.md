## Versioning Convention

The version number of the extension is specified in the `manifest.json` file. The format used is "Major.Minor.Patch.Revised" (E.g. "1.0.1.0"). Each part of the version number has a specific purpose:

- **Major Version**: Increased when an API change or significant change is made.
- **Minor Version**: Increased when functionality is added, or a medium-scale change is made.
- **Patch Version**: Increased when bug fixes are made, or minor things updated.
- **Revised Version**: Increased when minor wording or detail changed.

### Reset Behavior

Whenever the number to the left increases, all numbers to its right reset to 0. For example:
- If `1.1.2.3` receives a **Minor** version upgrade, it becomes `1.2.0`.

It is assumed that all releases are **Revised Versions** of 0, unless otherwise specified.

## Browser Compatability

This extension only works with browsers that support Google Accounts Integration (GAIA). This includes browsers like Chrome and Brave, but does not support Arc browser.
